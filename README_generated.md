  ## Description
  <!-- adding project description from user entered input data -->
  This application serves as the homepage for the fictional Hemlock Fitness and Training Center - a long-standing Philadelphia fitness facility that borrows its name from the state tree of Pennsylvania, the Eastern Hemlock. Its primary aim is to offer insight for prospective customers into its staff, location, and facilities. As an established business in a highly competitive market, it is vital to have an online presence in order to ensure that the business remains visible and accessible for both existing and potential new customers. As a class project this assignment served as a chance to exercise our newly learned back-end development skills with Node.js, Object-Oriented Programming, Express.js, MySQL, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), and the Model-View-Controller paradigm in tandem with our previously learned front-end skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API technologies. This exercise occurred in a collaborative group environment where each member had to handle different aspects of a complex project in order to put together a complete, functional end product by a set deadline.

  ## Usage
  <!-- adding project usage from user entered input data -->
  The below screenshot captures the application's homepage. From here the user can navigate to any area of the site using the links in navigation header. The About Us, Our Team, and Our Classes links all send the user to self-explanatory pages that contain static information on each subject. The Contact Us link integrates the Leaflet.js map to allow the user to see where Hemlock is located as well as how to get in touch.  The Log-In page allows a user with an existing account to log-in to their account and provides a sign-up section for new users to create their account.  Once logged in, users can select one or more activities that they are interested in and add them to their schedule.  After a user has selected activities that they are interested in and submitted the form, a list of their selected activities is provided to them. From this dashboard the user can return to the prior form and edit their activities of interest as needed.
